In these COVID-19 times, there is an urgent need to disseminate credible COVID related information in local languages.

To address this issue, we have built a crowd-sourced translation platform, Anuvad, using weblate. Here, people can translate resources to their own (or preferred) language. The platform is equipped with features such as Version Control system, Glossary, Translation Memory among others to ensure simple, manageable, and consistent translations.
