Registration and user profile
=============================

Registration
------------

Everybody can browse projects, view translations or suggest translations by default.
Only registered users are allowed to actually save changes, and are credited for
every translation made.

You can register by following a few simple steps:

1. Fill out the registration form with your credentials.
2. Activate registration by following the link in the e-mail you receive.
3. Optionally adjust your profile to choose which languages you know.

.. _dashboard:

Dashboard
---------

When you log in, you will see an overview of COVID19 topics and COVID19 resources,
as well as their respective translation progression.

Resources you are watching are shown by default, and cross-referenced with your preferred languages.

.. hint::

    You can switch to different views using the navigation tabs.

The menu has these options:

- :guilabel:`Projects` > :guilabel:`Browse all projects` in the main menu (or in the menu
  :guilabel:`Tools` â†’ :guilabel:`All projects` in the Dashboard) showing translation status
  for each COVID19 topic on the Anuvad instance.
- Selecting a language in the main menu :guilabel:`Languages` will show translation status of all projects,
  filtered by one of your primary languages.
- :guilabel:`Watched translations` in the Dashboard will show translation status of only those COVID19 topics you are watching, filtered by your primary languages.


User profile
------------
The user profile is accessible by clicking your user icon in the top-right of the top menu, then the :guilabel:`Settings` menu.

The user profile contains your preferences. Name and e-mail address is used in VCS commits, so keep this info accurate.


.. note::

    All language selections only offer currently translated languages.

.. hint::

    Request or add other languages you want to translate by clicking the button to make
    them available too.

Translated languages
++++++++++++++++++++

Choose which languages you prefer to translate, and they will be offered on the
main page of watched projects, so that you have easier access to these all translations
in each of those languages.

.. _secondary-languages:

Secondary languages
+++++++++++++++++++

You can define which secondary languages are shown to you as a guide while translating.
An example can be seen in the following image, where
the Hebrew language is shown as secondarily:

Editor link
+++++++++++

A source code link is shown in the web-browser configured in the
:ref:`component` by default.

.. hint::

    By setting the :guilabel:`Editor link`, you use your local editor to open the VCS source code
    file of translated strings. You can use :ref:`markup`.

    Usually something like ``editor://open/?file={{filename}}&line={{line}}`` is a good option.

.. seealso::

    You can find more info on registering custom URL protocols for the editor in
    the `Nette documentation <https://tracy.nette.org/en/open-files-in-ide>`_.

.. _subscriptions:

Notifications
-------------

Subscribe to various notifications from the :guilabel:`Subscriptions` tab.
Notifications for selected events on watched or administered
projects will be sent to you per e-mail.

Some of the notifications are sent only for events in your languages (for
example about new strings to translate), while some trigger at component level
(for example merge errors). These two groups of notifications are visually
separated in the settings.

You can toggle notifications for watched COVID19 topics and administered COVID19 topics and it
can be further tweaked (or muted) per project and component. Visit the component
page and select appropriate choice from the :guilabel:`Watching` menu.

.. note::

    You will not receive notifications for your own actions.

Account
-------

The :guilabel:`Account` tab lets you set up basic account details,
connect various services you can use to login into Weblate, completely
remove your account, or download your user data.

.. note::

   The list of services depends on your Weblate configuration, but can be made to
   include popular sites such as GitLab, GitHub, Google, Facebook, or Bitbucket or other
   OAuth 2.0 providers.
